## Description
A picture quiz created from random Wikipedia articles and their images. Guess wich article the image shown comes from.

## How it works
When the page loads it fetches 4 random articles with images that are decently big through the API. These are checked so there is one article with an image from Wikimedia Commons that is not used in any of the other articles. The article titles are shown together with that one image and the user guesses which one it is from. After clicking on show answer, it is revealed, along with the excerpt from the article. The user can then click a button for a new quiz (or use 'n' on the keyboard).
